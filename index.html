    <h2>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
      the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
      the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
      in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or
      conversations?”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
      day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
      a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
      daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
      it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear!
      Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it
      occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
      it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
      <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and
      then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind
      that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or
      a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
      field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
      large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
